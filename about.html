                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>Out Loud & United (OLU) was founded with a powerful vision: to create a Rwanda where every queer individual especially LGBTQ+ residents, refugees, and asylum seekers can live authentically, with dignity, and with full access to opportunities that enable them to thrive.</p>
                    
                    <p>Born from the recognition that our community faces unique challenges in accessing basic rights, inclusive healthcare, and full social acceptance, OLU emerged as a beacon of hope and change, with a strategic focus on achieving economic empowerment.</p>
                    
                    <p>Our organization represents the collective voice of a community that has long been marginalized. Through grassroots organizing, strategic human rights advocacy, and comprehensive community-centered programming, we are building resilience. Central to our mission is enabling economic independence through vital programs like vocational training, entrepreneurship, and livelihood support, alongside facilitating integration and access to essential services.</p>
                    
                    <p>We are actively building bridges of understanding while simultaneously working to dismantle the systemic barriers that prevent our community members from reaching their full potential and securing an empowered future.</p>

                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Community-Centered Programming</h3>
                    <p>We believe the best solutions come straight from the community. Our programs are designed by and for queer individuals, including LGBTQ+ residents, asylum seekers, and refugees, so they directly address the real needs and priorities identified by our members.

This approach guides all our work, especially in providing vocational training, entrepreneurship workshops, and livelihood support, ensuring our programs lead to genuine economic independence for everyone we serve.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Evidence-Based Advocacy</h3>
                    <p>Our advocacy efforts are grounded in research, data, and evidence that clearly demonstrates the challenges faced by all queer individuals, especially LGBTQ+ residents, refugees, and asylum seekers. This evidence allows us to clearly show the positive impact of inclusive policies, particularly those that support economic empowerment and access to essential services.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Intersectional Perspective</h3>
                    <p>We recognize that queer individuals may face multiple, overlapping forms of discrimination. Our work takes into account the diverse identities and experiences within our community, including factors like refugee status, gender, age, socioeconomic status (which ties into financial need), and ability, to ensure our support is truly holistic and effective.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>Collaborative Partnerships</h3>
                    <p>We work closely with other civil society organizations, government agencies, and partners including healthcare providers and those focused on economic opportunity to create systemic change. These partnerships help us maximize our collective impact and ensure our community members, including refugees and asylum seekers, get access to the essential services and support they need to thrive.</p>
